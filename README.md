# Chicago-Crime-Analysis
 
## Purpose:

### The purpose of this repository is to pull the raw crime data in chicago from the years 2001 to near present and prepare the data to be separated into individual data sets based on the year for later analysis in Tableau ( a link will be at the end of this README ). Afterwards, we will answer a few basic questions with some visualizations before delving deeper in Tableau.

## For our first question our shareholder would like us to figure out which district in chicago has the most and least crime.

### District 8 displays the most amount of crime at over 1/2 a million cases.

### The district that has the least, featuring little to no crime in comparison is District 21

## The second question we have been tasked with answering is; which holidays reveal an increase in the number of crimes and are there any holidays that provide a decrease in the number of crimes.

### among holidays in the US, New Year's Day had the most amount of crimes committed on it; and Juneteenth National Independence Day (Observed) interestingly showed the least amount of crime committed on it for various reasons.

## The next question that our shareholder had for us is what months have the most crime and which have the least? Do any individual crimes not follow this pattern? If so, which crimes?

### The 3 months with the most crime are July, August, and June in that order

### Only a small handful of exceptions don't follow the trend of peak time for crime and these crimes are public peace violations, offenses involving children, liquor law violations, human trafficking, and kidnapping
